  > Do you need permission from your teammates and project partner to share certain snippets of code or their intellectual property? 

I do not intend to share the complete code with anyone outside the team, except for my contributions to the project.

 > How do you distinguish your work from that of the other members of the team? 

Everyoneâ€™s contributions are easy to distinguish, because each of us is completing our own part, and there is no overlap.

 > What content do you want control over and what do you want your name attached to (on your page and others')? 

I am one of the contributors of the project and I have contributed in some aspects. On the page of my profile, organizations should add OnSchooler.

> What's the best platform for showing off your work? 

In GitHub. 

> How much detail should you include? 

Contains algorithm ideas and pseudo code.
