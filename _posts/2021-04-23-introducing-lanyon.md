### OnSchooler

### Introduction - OnSchooler

Onschooler is an e-learning platform that is like an interactive textbook, lecture, workbook, and quiz.  
https://lessons.onschooler.com/ 

* The system was first tested for five years (2000-2005) in a private lab school
* Offers lectures, textbooks, worksheets, drill and practice, and quizzes
* Hands on learning which incorporates problem solving, teamwork, multiple subject areas, research, creativity, fun, and inquiry-based learning
* The primary customers are home schooled students
* Help students complete supplementary educational resources


### Project Requirements

* Improve UI/UX
* Improve lesson writer experience 
* Improve Google sign-in functionality


### My Contributions

* Export the database from the BACPAC file
* Connect the entire project to the database to ensure that the project can run on the Windows platform
* Improve UI/UX, including deleting duplicate keys and merged functions into the menu bar
* Fix the bug that will log out after clicking the logo
* Update the welcome email of the learning system to registered users
* Hide the quiz score in the URL bar to prevent students from tampering with the score


### Challenges that I Overcame

* Challenging to setup the database for Mac OS users 
* Migrating from old Google+ API to the new Google API
* How to look at that data by restoring or importing it to a local SQL Server.
* Download SQL Server 2019 Developer
* Download SQL Server Management Studio
* Challenging to navigate a large codebase without documentation
* Unfamiliar with ASP.NET and C#
